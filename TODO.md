# ZSH Features TODO:

- Automatic change detection and versioning (so I don't forget to sync my zsh stuff between computers and VPS)
- Automatic tool detection (enable/disable shit based on if the command is available)
- Automatic tool instalation?
- git utils for prompt and general stuff
- Cargo utils for prompt and general stuff
- GPG integration
- Prompt (with printing utils to make it less painful to change), with extras:
    - Git branch
    - Cargo integration
    - Execution time
    - Error codes and possible translation functionality?
    - Possible custom directory printing to prefix the directory with the git/cargo folder?
    (I.E. ~/Documents/Rust> rust|git:esp-test/src/)
    - Resizing of prompt based on available screen width
    - compact mode
    - PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, etc.
- Jobs
- Possible package manager integration and update manager?
- MOTD with useful shit
- systemd user/system service utilities
- Cool name (ratz? zrat? rat-shell? (Nah that one's probably for my shell implementation), zsh-rat?)
- Quick browsing and viewing utilities? (part of global utility function?)
- Custom syntax highlighting? (Oh fucking boy, leave that one as a side thing lol)
